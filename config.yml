  # Maximum age of post (in minutes).  Bids not accepted are returned, if
  # refunds are enabled.  7,200 minutes is 5 days.  Setting this avoids

  # the window is 11 hours away from payout, thus locked during the window.

  # Batch vote weight is split between the bidders.  This value also sets the

  # When calculating a window, a bid that reaches this weight will take the
  # entire window.  All other bids will be processed in the next window.  This
  # will address situations where people "over-bid" which shocks the window.

  # 12-hours until cashout and cannot be upvoted.  By default, the `max_age`
  # option set at 7200 precludes the need to set this option to true.  But if
  # you configure `max_age` to allow voting exacly up to the lock-out point,
  # then it's handy to set this option to true because the blockchain will
  # return a lockout error that drotto can use to safely initiate a bounce.
